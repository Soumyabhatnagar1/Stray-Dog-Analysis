# 🐶 Stray-Dog-Analysis
This project analyzes real-world data related to stray dog sightings, adoptions, vaccinations, and location-wise distribution to understand patterns and support better decision-making for animal welfare. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can help NGOs, municipal bodies, and rescue volunteers plan awareness drives, allocate resources, and improve adoption and vaccination efforts.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used:

1. Python
   1. Pandas – Data cleaning, manipulation, and structuring
   2. NumPy – Numerical operations
   3. Matplotlib – Data exploration & temporary visualizations
   4. Jupyter Notebook – Development & testing
2. SQL
SQL queries for filtering, grouping, aggregating, and preparing datasets
3. Power BI
   1. Dashboard creation
   2. Data modeling & DAX measures
   3. Interactive visuals like clustered column charts, line charts, treemaps, and cards
4. Other Tools
   1. Excel/CSV files for raw data
   2. Power Query for initial data transformation

## ⭐ Key Features

  1. 📌 Area-wise Stray Dog Count – Identifies hotspots with the highest stray dog presence.
  2. 📅 Monthly Trends – Shows adoption and vaccination patterns across months.
  3. 🏘️ Location Distribution Map – Highlights where most sightings are reported.
  4. 📈 Interactive Dashboard – Users can filter data by area, category, month, etc.
  5. 🐕 Category/Breed Distribution – Helps understand which dog types are most commonly reported.
  6. 🔍 Data Cleaning Pipeline – Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
  7. 📊 Comparative Charts – Provides visual clarity through pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, and treemaps.

## 📊 Results & Insights

  🔹 High-density zones were identified where stray dog incidents are more frequent, helping target rescue and vaccination efforts.
  🔹 Vaccination data showed certain months had significantly lower activity, indicating a need for awareness drives.
  🔹 Adoption trends revealed which periods saw higher adoption rates and which categories of dogs were adopted more often.
  🔹 Area-based comparison helped prioritize locations requiring immediate attention from welfare teams.
  🔹 Dashboard visuals made it easier to track year-wise or month-wise progress in both adoption and vaccination operations.
  🔹 Patterns and anomalies in sightings helped suggest where new shelters or feeding points may be required.
